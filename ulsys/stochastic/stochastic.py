    Like it's sister function in the standard module this function supports
    several kinds of input.
    
    The different kinds of input are:
    
        A string of format "S R -> Abc", where S is the symbol, R is a 
        real valued probability constant and Abc is the output symbols.
        R is optional, if R is omitted then the probability constant is assumed
        to be 1.0.
        
        A tuple (S, R, Abc, ...) where the tokens means the same as in the prior
        scenario. Abc should be an iterable type. R must be anything supported
        by float().
    
    If more than one input is given, the result is a list of rules.
    
    Example of parsed input:    
    
    >>> production("F 0.3->F++F++F", "F 0.7->F+F+F", "A->B")
    [('F', 0.3, ['F', '+', '+', 'F', '+', '+', 'F']), ('F', 0.7, ['F', '+', 'F', '+', 'F']), ('A', 1.0, ['B'])]

    """Evaluates a stochastic system. 
    
    A stochastic system consists of an axiom, an alphabet and the rules. In this
    module the alphabet is inferred from the axiom and the rules.
    
    Each rule has an associated symbol S, a probability R and a production Abc.
    
    Each iteration, every symbol S in the axiom is iterated. We find the rules
    for the symbol and based on the probability R we pick one. S is replaced
    with the rule's production Abc, itself a list of symbols.
    
    At the end of an iteration the axiom for the next iteration is set to the
    result of this process.
    
    Since there can be multiple production rules for a symbol in a stochastic 
    L-System we must enforce certain requirements. 
    
        For an input symbol S, its production rules (if any) has an associated 
        probability P. The total sum of P for all the rules for S must be 
        greater than zero. Each individual rules probability is scaled by the
        total sum, so for example two rules for S, with P 2 and 4 are scaled
        by 1/6 to 1/3 and 2/3.
        
    Being a stochastic system it is generally not deterministic, you can force
    determinism by providing your own pseudo-random number generator.
    
    axiom is a list of starting symbols.
    rules is any of the following:
        a dictionary type S->[(R, Symbols)], like {1: [(0.2, [1, 2, 3])]}
        a list of tuples as the ones produced by the function production()
        a single tuple as the ones produced by the function production()
    n is the number of iterations.
    
    rng is an optional value that is expected to be either None, or a function
    that returns a floating point value between 0 and 1.
