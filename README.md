# ulsys
"Micro" LSys. A small Python 3+ library for evaluating Lindenmayer-systems, with a small accompanying turtle implementation for pretty drawings.

## Goals 
These are the desired goals with the library. ulsys is not an attempt to write the most performant, most feature complete L-System evaluator, at least for now. But it strives to be simple to use and good enough for most scenarios.

### Primary goals
- Very simple to use and get running.
- Evaluating simple Lindenmayer systems (non-stochastic, non-parametric)
- A small Turtle implementation that easily supports different backends
- Easy to read code, to serve as an example implementation of an L-System evaluator.
- At least one vector graphics Turtle backend

### Secondary goals
- Performance
- Support for stochastic Lindenmayer systems

## Platform
Python 3+
